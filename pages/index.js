                1. Whether you cultivated or had a release (ejaculation). <br />

                I want this to be the best place for you to learn and take the right steps into this work.
                Learning the techniques is one of the easier aspects of the practice where it can be picked up from books.

                The hardest part about this work is the <strong>doing</strong> part. When you start actually doing it you will experience problems 
                that you require support and advice to work through. Getting help from other men doing this work gives you the best chance 
                to succesfully continue this work long term. I also believe that there is nothing more impactful than a structured accountability
                system for building new habits.

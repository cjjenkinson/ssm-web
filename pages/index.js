                What is Semen Retention?
              </Heading>

              <Text mt={4} fontSize="lg">
                Good question. Semen Retention is a centuries-old practice that allows you to harness your bodyâ€™s vital energy to drive improved mental, physical and energetic well-being.
              </Text>

              <Text mt={4} fontStyle="italic" fontSize="lg">
                The basic purpose of the practice is to increase as much as possible the quantity of life-giving, 
                age-retarding hormones secreted in a manâ€™s body during sexual excitement, while at 
                the same time decreasing as much as possible the loss of semen and its related hormones through ejaculation.
